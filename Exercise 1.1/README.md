# Simple Addition Script

## Overview

This project consists of a simple Python script named `add.py` that prompts the user to enter two numbers, adds them together, and prints the result. It is developed in a virtual environment to ensure consistency and manage dependencies effectively.

## Setup and Installation

### Virtual Environment

- If you haven't already, set up a virtual environment named `<name-of-environment>` for this project.

### Requirements File

- A `requirements.txt` file is included, which lists all the necessary Python packages.
- To install these packages, activate your virtual environment and run:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Running the Script

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   source path/to/<name-of-environment>/bin/activate  # For Unix-like systems
   path	o\<name-of-environment>\Scriptsctivate     # For Windows
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   python add.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**: Enter two numbers as prompted, and the script will display their sum.
